-   **Modern UI/UX:** A beautiful dark theme with a minimalist design, custom fonts, and smooth button interactions, inspired by modern device calculators.
-   **Decimal Support:** Handles floating-point calculations with results rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using fundamental web technologies, demonstrating a strong command of the basics.

| Technology | Badge | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white) | Used for the core structure and semantic layout of the calculator. |
| **CSS3** | ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=flat&logo=css3&logoColor=white) | Used for modern styling, including CSS Grid for the button layout, Flexbox for alignment, custom fonts, and a responsive dark theme. |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) | Powers the entire logic of the calculator, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and all arithmetic calculations. |

## Project Structure

The repository has a simple and intuitive structure:

```
.
├── index.html      # The main HTML file containing the calculator's structure.
├── style.css       # The CSS file for all styling and layout.
└── script.js       # The JavaScript file containing all the logic and functionality.
```

## Learning Outcomes / Skills Demonstrated

This project was a great opportunity to practice and showcase the following skills:

-   **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating the display and handling user input by directly manipulating HTML elements with JavaScript.
-   **Event Handling:** Capturing and processing user clicks on all buttons to drive the calculator's logic.
-   **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Implementing a complex and responsive button layout using modern CSS Grid, and centering the application with Flexbox.
-   **Modern Styling:** Applying custom fonts, box shadows, and a clean color scheme to create a professional and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
-   **Logical Thinking:** Developing the core logic for a calculator, including handling different operations, clearing input, and displaying results.

## Future Enhancements / Roadmap

While the current version is fully functional, here are some potential features to add in the future:

-   [ ] **Keyboard Support:** Allow users to perform calculations using their physical keyboard.
-   [ ] **Calculation History:** Add a feature to view recent calculations.
-   [ ] **Theme Switcher:** Implement a toggle for light and dark modes.
-   [ ] **Advanced Math Functions:** Introduce scientific functions like square root, power, and trigonometric operations.
